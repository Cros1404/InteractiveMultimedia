    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Hyper Text Markup Language Used to define the structure of a web page by marking
      and dividing things into elements using tags
    </p>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets Style sheet language that defines formatting of a document
      written in markup language. Typically used with HTML. HTML is content, CSS
      is presentation. CSS defines how things look visually. CSS reduces complexity
      and repetition, because one external .css file can be used on multiple HTML
      documents that have elements that need identical formatting, and if formatting
      needs to be changed across all the HTML documents using that file, only that
      one .css file needs to be edited.
    </p>

    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      High-level, dynamic, weakly typed, and interpreted programming language. Javascript
      code is run on the client, the web browser. It is used to make websites interactive,
      dynamic. Javascript uses the HTML DOM to access and change elements of an HTML
      document.
    </p>

    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>
      Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Communication protocol at the application layer. Used
      to send and recieve hypertext, like HTML documents. HTTP operates on client-server
      basis. An HTTP client, that can be a browser, sends requests for web resources
      to the server. HTTP resources are identified by a URL. HTTP also defines so
      called "HTTP methods", that show what action the client wants to perform on
      the resource requested, for example, typically to request an HTML document
      a "GET method" is used. Other common methods are POST, PUT and DELETE.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML5</h2>

    <p>
      HTML5 is the current version of the HTML standard. HTML5 introduced new semantic
      elements, new attributes to form elements, new graphic elements - SVG and canvas
      - and new multimedia elements - &lt;audio> and &lt;video>. It also introduced
      new API's, for example, HTML Geolocation and HTML Local Storage.</p>

    <h2>DHTML</h2>

    <p>DHTML is a collection of technologies used to make interactive, animated web
      pages by using a static markup language, clien-side scripting language, presentation
      definition language and the DOM - basically: HTML, CSS and Javascript. DHTML
      enables scripting languages (Javascript) to change variables of definition
      language (CSS), which changes the visual look of otherwise static web page.
      This is done after the web page is fully loaded and during the viewing of it.
      With DHTML there is no interaction with a web server, all actions are executed
      in Javascript on the client side.</p>
