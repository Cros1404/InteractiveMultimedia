    <h2>What is the purpose of the RWD? Why it is used? How things are done before RWD?
      What is the difference?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of RWD is to make websites look and feel good on different screen sizes.
      Unresponsive websites designed for desktop can look bad on very small or very
      large screens. One problem, for example, that RWD solves is that unresponsive
      websites designed for desktop will probably have to be scrolled horizontally
      on smaller phone screens, which can be tedious and annoying - RWD makes it
      so the website adapts so that it needs only vertical scrolling. Before RWD
      separate website versions were made specifically for phones, for exmaple, or
      for specific devices, like "mobile.nytimes.com". The difference now is that
      there is no need for separate versions of websites for specific devices, because
      responsive websites can adapt and look good on any screen size.
    </p>
    <h2>How css media queries can help you building responsive web sites?
    </h2>
    <p>
      With media queries you can find out information about the current device, for example,
      width and height of the screen, orientation (landscape or portrait mode) or
      its resolution. In addition, an expression that evaluates to true or false
      is used to resolve whether to use a certain media query style. For example,
      a style will be applied only if screen is wider than 1000px or only if width
      is less than 1000px. This means that you can set width breakpoints for when
      design should change to accomadate the screen size of the current device.
    </p>

    <h2>Why to use em (font) based sizing for example margins?</h2>
    <p>
      Because when element is using em, to determine the actual size, it will use the font
      size of it's parent element. This means that if user has made the font size
      smaller or bigger, all padding, margins and fonts that are using em will adjust
      accordingly, this way all proportions of the design will be conserved. Em means
      the size of the letter "M", therefore it is linked to font size.

    <h2>Article is already 7 years old, do we have any new technology which can be used
      to achieve same type of UI responsiveness as described in the article. Buzz
      words: (CSS Grid, Flexbox)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>CSS Grid</strong> - a grid element consists of items divided into rows and
      columns. Items can span multiple rows or columns. CSS grids perserve the proportions
      of its items if screen size changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flexbox</strong> - flexbox consists of one or more child elements. Flexbox
      has some responsive features. Child elements can wrap and stack in the flexbox
      if it's width or height changes. Also proportions will be perserved between
      the child elements and the spacing around them if flexbox size changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bootstrap</strong> - popular framework for making responsive websites. Bootstrap
      has a grid system that allows to divide a page into 12 columns, you can group
      columns to make wider columns. Columns will rearrange automatically when screen
      size changes, for example, columns that are side by side on a desktop screen
      could be made to stack vertically on a phone screen.
