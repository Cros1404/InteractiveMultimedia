    <h2>HOW TO DESIGN A RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN</h2>
    <p>
      <small>Published 17/01/2018</small>
      <br>
      <br> The purpose of RWD is to make websites look and feel good on different screen
      sizes. Unresponsive websites designed for desktop can look bad on very small
      or very large screens. One problem, for example, that RWD solves is that unresponsive
      websites designed for desktop will probably have to be scrolled horizontally
      on smaller phone screens, which can be tedious and annoying - RWD makes it
      so the website adapts so that it needs only vertical scrolling. Before RWD
      separate website versions were made specifically for phones, for exmaple, or
      for specific devices, like "mobile.nytimes.com". The difference now is that
      there is no need for separate versions of websites for specific devices, because
      responsive websites can adapt and look good on any screen size.
