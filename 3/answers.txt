 What kind of problems web sockets solve? In what kind of situations you should
 use them?

Before web sockets, usually HTTP communication was operating on request/response
paradigm. This meant that clients had to send a request to recieve data from 
the server, server couldn't just sent data by itself whenever it wanted, server
could not initiate a connection. Long polling was a workaround for this problem,
but there was also another problem - they carried overhead of HTTP, which is 
problematic for low-latency applications, like online video games. WebSockets
solve these problems by using WebSocket communication protocol and keeping the
connection open between client and server, each of which can send data at any 
time.

You should use WebSockets when you need low-latency, close to real-time 
communication between client and server. For example, multiplayer online games,
chat apps, live sports tickers and social streams updating realtime.
