How it can help you as web developer?

In some cases, for example, with heavy DOM manipulation, jQuery might be much 
easier to use than pure JavaScript. jQuery helps separate your HTML code from
your JavaScript code, because it's easier to add event handlers to elements.
Chainable commands can also help make your code shorter and clearer. Like other
JavaScript toolkits, jQuery also aims to handle many cross-browser 
incompabilities. With jQuery you can also implement AJAX and add animations and
effects.
