    <h1>What you can do with the jQuery?</h1>
    <p>
      Easier DOM manipulation and traversal
      <br>Handle events
      <br>Animations and effects Use AJAX
      <br>JSON parsing
      <br>Multi-browser support
      <br>Chain commands
    </p>
    <h1>How it can help you as web developer?</h1>
    <p>In some cases, for example, with heavy DOM manipulation, jQuery might be much
      easier to use than pure JavaScript. jQuery helps separate your HTML code from
      your JavaScript code, because it's easier to add event handlers to elements.
      Chainable commands can also help make your code shorter and clearer. Like other
      JavaScript toolkits, jQuery also aims to handle many cross-browser incompabilities.
      With jQuery you can also implement AJAX and add animations and effects.</p>
    <h1>If you think our earlier participant list app, in what kind of issues you could
      use jQuery?</h1>
    <p>If we wanted to maker our code shorter, improve cross-browser compatability,
      add AJAX or animations.</p>
    <h1>What are CDNs? What kind of benefits you get if you use them?</h1>
    <p>A collection of servers spread over many geographical places. These servers store
      identical copies of data that clients can request, and only the closest server
      will send the data to the client. This makes data delivery faster and reduces
      potential traffic congestion. CDNs are often used for stylesheets and Javascript
      files of libraries like jQuery and Bootstrap. When you use CDNs for these libraries,
      you reduce load on your own server, reduce latency, because CDNs might be geographically
      closer to the client than your server, and, since a lot of websites use these
      CDNs, the file the client is trying to download might already be cached from
      that CDNs, so client doesn't have download it again, improving performance.</p>
